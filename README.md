# VBA_MACROS
I have used 3 sample datasets, "Agency Commissions TEST SAMPLE", "Agency Bonus", "Agency Charges". I have written VBA code and record macros to extract data from these 3 datasets to my worksheets, create history, create button for generate PDF file, format blank spaces and generate update data from sources.
